ICS 212 project created a UI that asked customers for a list of options regarding what they wanted to do with their profiles.

The database was a multi-step project that separated front-end user response with back-end code that has functions that could add records to a linked list that was sorted by account number associated with them, delete records while maintaining sorted order, print all records, find a specific record by account number, write all records to a txt file before quitting, free all data used by the malloc operation while exiting the program, and read data from the text file to add back all records inputted before quitting.

This program was initially done in C, then redone with C++ syntax, and finally updated to Java syntax.

Here are some functions from the original C iteration of the application
