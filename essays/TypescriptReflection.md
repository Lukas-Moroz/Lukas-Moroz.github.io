## A new language

Working primarily in C, C++, and minimal Java before attempting to learn TypeScript, I found the switch less horrible than I initially thought. The basics carried over quite smoothly with only tiny differences in syntax for basic actions and statements. I was very surprised by the fact that you don't need semi-colons for a majority of the syntax, which is something that was hardwired into my brain from previously taking a difficult class in C/C++. I completed the FreeCodeCamp course on JavaScript quite quickly only having difficulty with object properties syntax and recursion as a concept (something that I will work on in the future). After completing a quick rundown of the features added to Typescript, I can understand the need for an upgrade from JavaScript. I liked that all JavaScript works on Typescript with the added features like types while catching errors in the editor without needing to run your buggy code. I'm excited to continue learning TypeScript and use it to its full potential.

## WODs and athletic software engineering 

When I first heard of the concept of WODs and the idea of athletic software engineering I was initially scared of what that would do to my grade. Having a credit-no-credit approach to coding is very daunting because of the nature of programming. I can remember countless hours being wasted looking through my code that wouldn't compile just to find out my issue was an extra letter being capitalized or a word spelled incorrectly. These errors are annoying but being put on a timer forces you to think deeply about every line that you write while also making your code efficient. Not only does it rewire how you think about coding, but it also prepares you for coding interviews more effectively. It is still stressful not knowing what you will be quizzed on until the timer starts, but there is no better practice than getting thrown into the fire.
