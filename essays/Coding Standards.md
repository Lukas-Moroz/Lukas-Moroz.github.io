## VSCode is solid

I had some experience with VSCode prior to this course but I was following a very full proof guide that allowed or no mistakes or fuzzy areas. I'm glad that the guide set up for 314 had fuzzy areas as it allowed me to learn some more of the ins and outs of VSCode. As an IDE, I think it is one of the better ones, launching fast, supporting plenty of languages, and having amazing extensions like github copilot(I don't like using it becuase it makes coding too easy) and style guides that help you write clean and concise code. I am a big fan of the multipl tabs in VSCode as it allows you to see different layers of your code quickly. In our case being able to have an html boilerplate, TypeScript code and the translated Javascript code on back-to-back-to-back tabs, makes coding and seeing possible mistakes a lot easier.
