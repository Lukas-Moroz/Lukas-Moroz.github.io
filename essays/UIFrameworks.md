## HTML and CSS

I am still a rookie to web dev but I enjoyed HTML and the basics of CSS. I like how it's split up into different languages that work off eachother for format and style but that dose lead to some confusions when working in one or the other. I found myself getting lost with the HTML syntax since everything, even classes in CSS are placed in them when referring to them in HTML. I hate aligning thing but everything else seemed to make sense. Overall, I enjoyed learning the basics of HTML and CSS.

## Bootstrap

Splitting HTML and CSS was fun, but the jump to Bootstrap was really hard. It doesn't seem hard but if you are thrown as much random, bootstrap specific syntax, all at once, it becomes tedious and hard to follow. I fell really far behind and everything became hard to follow becuase the bootstrap syntax and the fact that most is done in HTML with very minimal CSS. I thought the icons and some stuff mae it more easy, but I was not experienced enough in HTML or CSS alone that I shouldv'e needed to jump to a new framework like bootstrap.

## Closing Statement

I liked HTML and CSS but hated Bootstrap. I think that if I had more practice with all the concepts in all the categories, I wouldve enjoyed that more. The class that I'm in is too fast paced and I have to learn more on my own than in class, which makes it hard to juggle with other responsibilities. Overall I liked it, but wish we had more time to fully understand instead of getting told we aren't moving fast enough.
